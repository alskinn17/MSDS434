The Final Project folder contains all source code currently developed for the Final Project.

The model created will predict English Premier League soccer match results based on certain stats of each team.

The stats are aggregate of their last 3 matches.



The Weekly Demo folder contains all relevant code and commands used during weekly demonstration videos. 
There is not a folder for each week because not every week required commands. 
There is also not every piece of code in each demo because I was deleting GCP projects as I went so not everything is still available for me.
